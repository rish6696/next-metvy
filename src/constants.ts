export const aboutUs = `Having bagged an internship at Ogilvy, Shawrya was going through a book on the life and journey of 
Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani - how he had leveraged his networking skills, from officials to people he met at
tea-stalls, to get what he wanted. This brought to Shawrya’s mind the difficulties that we face when it
comes to networking, and ironically, we are the generation of social networking. It was this moment
that started the journey named Metvy. He decided to network with as many people as possible, and 
needless to say, it wasn’t a bed of roses. This pushed him into wondering that in the world where
everything is automated, what if this could be too? What if he could give everyone a chance to utilize
this sea of human potential around them? Because for all we know the person we are in search of
might be just beside us, and we wouldn’t know about it at all. But what if they could?

Like every great initiative, this too started off as an idea - an idea that was addictive, an idea which,
if solved could cease a lot of problems. It is then that the proper concept of Metvy and what it would
be doing was finalized. Metvy was supposed to aim at utilizing the infinite human potential present
hyper-locally through an automated intuitive platform that would provide need-based networking
where people would be able to find the kind of people they were looking for around them.

Shawrya’s idea of Metvy met the support of Rajan and they both started on the journey of putting
Metvy on the charts. Their dedication and Metvy’s growing credibility led to the growth of the team
that is now called “The Metvy Family.”`;
